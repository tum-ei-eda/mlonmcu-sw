/** @name High-level DMA memory copy functions
 * The following functions can be used to trigger DMA transfers to copy data between the cluster memory (L1) and another memory outside the cluster (another cluster L1 or L2).
 * The DMA supports the following features:
 *   - Transfers are event-based. With event-based transfers the core can call a wait function to block execution until the transfer is done.
 *   - The DMA supports 2D transfers which allows transfering a 2D tile in one command. Additional information must then be given to specify the width of the tile and the number of bytes between 2 lines of the tile.
 *   - The event sent at the end of the transfer is broadcasted to all cluster cores.
 *   - To identify specific transfers, the DMA provides a transfer identifier.
 *   - Multiple transfers can be launched simultaneously, with them being executed 2-4 in parallel, with more waiting in a queue.
